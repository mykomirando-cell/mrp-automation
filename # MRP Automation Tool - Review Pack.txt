# MRP Automation Tool - Review Package

## Overview
This Streamlit app computes **Material Requirements Planning (MRP)** for multiple warehouses and items.

Features included:
- Warehouse-specific MRP calculations
- Beginning and ending stock, weekly requirements
- Planned orders computation
- DTL (Days to Last) calculation and conditional formatting
- Description column included for clarity
- Numeric week values rounded to 2 decimals

## Input Files
All files must be uploaded via the Streamlit interface.

1. **Inventory.xlsx / .csv**
   - Columns: warehouse, item_id, on_hand_qty, uom

2. **Historical Weekly Issuance.xlsx / .csv**
   - Columns: warehouse, item_id, week_start (date), issued_qty, uom

3. **Scheduled Receipts.xlsx / .csv**
   - Columns: warehouse, item_id, week_start (date), qty, uom

4. **Item Master.xlsx / .csv**
   - Columns: warehouse, item_id, description, safety_stock, lead_time, MOQ, pack_size, uom

> Make sure the Item Master includes all required columns and no duplicates per warehouse-item combination.

## How It Works
1. **Upload input files** in the Streamlit interface.
2. **MRP calculation**:
   - Projected weekly demand is the latest 4-week historical average.
   - Planned orders are calculated to cover shortages and MOQ/pack size rules.
   - DTL = (End_SOH / avg_4wk_demand) * 7
3. **Tables Generated**:
   - **MRP Logic Table**: parameter vs. week, includes DTL with red highlight if <7 days.
   - **Upcoming Planned Orders Table**: sorted by release week, includes description.

## Notes for Review
- Verify first weeks’ DTL and planned orders.
- Check that `description` appears correctly in all tables.
- Ensure conditional formatting for DTL <7 works as expected.
- The app currently supports 12 weeks by default; adjust `num_weeks` in the script to test longer horizons.
